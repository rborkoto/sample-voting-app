Datadog Basic Implementation Guide

This README outlines the high-level requirements to implement core Datadog features, including infrastructure monitoring, APM, logs, RUM, dashboards, and monitors. It serves as a checklist rather than detailed step-by-step instructions.

⸻

1. Prerequisites
- Datadog Sandbox Account & Access: Valid Datadog organization with admin or integration privileges
- API & Application Keys: Generated API key for data ingestion and application key for dashboards/monitors
- Deploy the sample voting app

⸻

2. Infrastructure Monitoring

Requirements:
- Install and configure the Datadog Agent on all hosts (VMs, servers, containers)
- Define a tagging strategy (e.g., env, role, app) for resource grouping
- Enable core integrations for key services (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure)
- Verify host metrics ingestion and host metadata visibility
- Start here : https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/ 

⸻

3. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

Requirements:
- Instrument each service with the appropriate Datadog APM library (e.g., Python, Java, .NET)
- Configure service names and environment tags
- Enable distributed tracing and propagate trace headers across service boundaries
- Validate span collection and trace search in the APM UI
- Start here : https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/ 

⸻

4. Logs

Requirements:
- Configure log collection in the Datadog Agent or via a centralized log shipper (e.g., Fluentd, Logstash)
- Set up parsing rules or Grok to structure logs
- Define key log sources and file paths
- Apply sensitive data masking or scrubbing policies as needed
- Confirm log ingestion and searchable indices in the Logs Explorer
- Start here : https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/ 

⸻

5. Real User Monitoring (RUM)

Requirements:
- Add the Datadog RUM browser SDK snippet to web front-end(s)
- Set an appropriate applicationId, clientToken, and privacy level
- Define session sampling rates for metrics and session replay
- Validate session events, performance metrics, and user actions in RUM Explorer
- Start here : https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/  

⸻

6. Dashboards

Requirements:
- Create an infrastructure overview dashboard (host health, CPU, memory)
- Build APM service dashboards with key traces, latency, and error rates
- Add Logs analytics widgets for top log sources and anomalies
- Include RUM performance metrics (page load times, user actions)
- Use template variables for environment or service filtering
- Start here : https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/

⸻

7. Monitors

Requirements:
- Define monitors for critical infrastructure metrics (CPU, disk, network)
- Set up APM monitors for error rate thresholds and high latency
- Create log-based monitors for repeating error patterns or security events
- Add RUM monitors for slow page loads or JS errors
- Configure notification channels (Slack, email) and escalation policies

⸻

8. Validation & Handoff:
- Smoke Tests: Verify data flow for metrics, traces, logs, and RUM events
- Review Dashboards: Confirm accuracy and relevance of widgets
- Test Alerts: Trigger monitors to ensure notifications are delivered
- Start here : https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/
